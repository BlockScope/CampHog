My activity on github is nicely summarised by <a

### Flying High and Flying Far

I have but one major project for scoring in the sky and another for saying how
that is done.

* [**flare-timing**](http://www.flaretiming.com)  
A suite of command line apps for scoring hang gliding and paragliding
competitions and a website for publishing competitions scored this way with
comparisons to the official scores.
* [**CIVL-GAP**](https://github.com/BlockScope/CIVL-GAP)  
A mirror of the FAI-CIVL official scoring rules for hang gliding and
paragliding. Marked up in LaTeX and stored in a git repo, this is a place for
myself and others to raise questions about the rules, correct obvious mistakes,
add clarifying appendices and to suggest changes.

### Supporting Acts

I contribute to projects that I use or want to succeed.

* [**hpack-dhall**](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpack-dhall)  
I started contributing and ended up
[owner and maintainer](https://github.com/BlockScope/hpack-dhall/issues/3) of
this way to setup Haskell projects.
* [**uom-plugin**](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/uom-plugin)  
A compiler plugin for units of measure.
* [**pier**](https://github.com/judah/pier)  
I added [test-suite](https://github.com/judah/pier/issues/50) running to this
experimental way of building Haskell projects.
* [**paket**](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/)  
I helped document how to convert an existing solution to use paket,
[explaining](https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/commit/3db8c5b8701adf345c8cf4c1b3cfcb8d4bc11fca)
some assumptions in the way the project files need to be organized on disk.
This is now
a [tutorial](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/convert-from-nuget-tutorial.html).
* [**snack**](https://github.com/nmattia/snack/commits?author=philderbeast)  
An incremental build tool for Haskell projects.
