### Flying High and Flying Far

I have but one major project for scoring in the sky and another for saying how
that is done.

* [**flare-timing**](http://www.flaretiming.com)  
A suite of command line apps for scoring hang gliding and paragliding
competitions and a website for publishing competitions scored this way with
comparisons to the official scores.
* [**CIVL-GAP**](https://github.com/BlockScope/CIVL-GAP)  
A mirror of the FAI-CIVL official scoring rules for hang gliding and
paragliding. Marked up in LaTeX and stored in a git repo, this is a place for
myself and others to raise questions about the rules, correct obvious mistakes,
add clarifying appendices and to suggest changes.

A few of the packages making up flare-timing I've released to hackage.

* [siggy-chardust](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/siggy-chardust)
* [detour-via-sci](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/detour-via-sci)
* [detour-via-uom](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/detour-via-uom)
* [flight-igc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/flight-igc)
* [flight-kml](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/flight-kml)
