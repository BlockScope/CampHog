## [Crop Logic](http://www.croplogic.com)

`2008/02-2011/09`

This is an online management tool for potato growers based on a discrete
computer simulation of plant growth in response to soil structure and
hydraulics, weather, irrigation and fertilization. An optimizer runs the crop
model repeatedly to work out the best days to apply water and nitrogen.
