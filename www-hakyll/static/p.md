I develop software and climb. I would rather climb professionally and code for
pleasure. I have some advice that could apply to both activities:

* Check your knots and always have a backup.
* Gear freaking is a distraction.
* Muscle memory and good technique will get you there faster.
* Being on the sharp end is more exciting.

When I first started working as a software developer, the team I joined was
developing for DOS with Turbo Pascal on the 80486. I've learnt a lot since
then.

I've disorientated from objects and prefer first class functions, algebraic
data types and lazy evaluation.
