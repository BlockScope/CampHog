I develop software and climb. I would rather climb professionally and code for
pleasure. Let me share my experience and advice that run in parallel between
these two activities.

* Check your knots and always have a backup.
* Gear freaking is a distraction.
* Muscle memory and good technique will get you there faster.
* Being on the sharp end is more exciting.

When I first started working as a software developer, the team I joined was
developing for DOS with Turbo Pascal on the 80486. The industry was
reorientating towards objects and has since become fixated on them. I prefer
first class bare functions, algebraic data types and lazy evaluation.
