### Flying High Score

I've been a competition pilot, racing other hang glider pilots around
unseen turnpoints in the sky. It's a wild ride.

With data points coming in every second for upwards of a hundred pilots and
geometry on a sphere or ellipsoid, scoring is a complex task.  FAI-CIVL govern
the sport. They make the rules and provide FS, the offcial program or scoring.

The paragliding world cup has its own set of rules but these are very close to
those of FAI-CIVL. They use another program for scoring, CompCheck.

I help maintain FS and started flare-timing and CIVL-GAP.

* [**flare-timing**](http://www.flaretiming.com)  
    A reference implementation of the rules as a suite of command line apps,
    one for each step in the process of scoring.
* [**CIVL-GAP**](https://github.com/BlockScope/CIVL-GAP)  
    An upstream version of rules marked up in LaTeX with questions,
    corrections, clarifying appendices and suggested changes.

Packages from flare-timing released on hackage.
