I go by two monikers on the interwebs:

* **[\@philderbeast](/p)** is a nickname given to me by
[\@highluxphoto](https://twitter.com/highluxphoto)
* **[\@blockscope](/b)** is a company I own and work for doing software development

I spent my youth climbing back in the '80s.  With no sponsors to upset, new
route names were sometimes an irreverent play on words, twisted in bad taste or
simply bad puns. When you see a play on words, it's just play.
