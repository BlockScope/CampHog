I go by two monikers on the interwebs:

* **@philderbeast** is a nickname given to me by
[\@highluxphoto](https://twitter.com/highluxphoto)
* **@blockscope** is a company I own and work for doing software development

I spent my youth climbing back in the '80s.  With no sponsors to upset, new
route names were sometimes an irreverent play on words, twisted in bad taste or
simply bad puns. I made up more route names than I ever climbed.  I try to stay
true to my roots (routes with diversionary and distracting names) so you'll see
that:

* "post it, notes" are posted notes
* "reflected tweets" are mirrored tweets
* "fly the course" is a flying side project
* "supporting acts" is a list of open source contributions
* "worker threads" run through the timeline of my curriculum vitae
