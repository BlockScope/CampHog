I am a software developer, have been since 1995. I could list the tech I've
used but the list would be long. Some I really like, some I can tolerate to get
the job done but a lot of it I'd now shun when there are better alternatives
around. I'm not going to second guess your choice of tech. There are always
tradeoffs and constraints to consider.
