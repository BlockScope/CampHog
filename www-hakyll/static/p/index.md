I develop software and climb. I would rather climb professionally and code for
pleasure.

I can draw a lot of parallels between these two activities.

* On the sharp end, you're route finding and decision making.
* Following is much easier than leading.
* Guidebooks save a lot of wasted time searching for good lines.
* Both wreak arms and tweak fingers.
* Muscle memory and good technique reduce effort.

When I first started working as a software developer, the team I joined was
developing for DOS with Turbo Pascal.
