There's a great effort being made to create a language server for Haskell so
that we might have better editors. Various projects and people are coming
together to work on this. Beneath it all is ghc-lib_, an API for GHC decoupled
from GHC versions. I took this idea, the custom prelude idea and the idea of
using cabal mixins to avoid use of the ``{-# LANGUAGE CPP #-}`` pragma to
create a flatter API into the guts of GHC for those writing type checker
plugins and created ghc-corroborate_.
