title: Type Checker Plugs-Out Testing
tags: haskell, build

When getting ready to launch a human-rated spacecraft, one of the steps is
the plugs-out test. Can the the spacecraft function on its own without power
or fuel from all cables and umbilicals?

As part of my debugging efforts I have written some simple plugins that
demonstrate some things about type checker plugins. These I've collected into
a package, ghc-plugs-out. It is a multiple library package, each library is a
plugin. The test suites in the package each demonstrate something.
