I develop software and climb, unfortunately doing only one of these activities
professionally.

When choosing a company name, I went with [block
scope](/posts/2018-04-29-block-scope.html). It is a scoping rule in many
programming languages.  I'm also often out scoping new lines to climb on the
boulders ([blocs](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloc_(escalade)) in French).

When I first started working as a software developer, the team I joined was
developing for DOS with Turbo Pascal.
