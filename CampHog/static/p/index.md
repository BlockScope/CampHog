I develop software and climb. When choosing a company name,
I went with block scope. It is a scoping rule in many programming languages.
I also scope blocs when out searching for new boulder problems.

When I first started working as a software developer, the language was Turbo
Pascal, the target DOS or early Windows. Application development was on the
command line or the desktop. The web had pages and links but not apps.

I badly wanted to move to writing C++ and that soon happened. I enjoyed it at
the time and did a lot with it, fundamental stuff with containers, algorithms
threading and computer graphics.

I have to say that COM component programming with binary interfaces was a total
pain in the ass so I was onboard with dotNet. It was language agnostic, had
garbage collection, a high level intermediate language and just-in-time
compilation.
