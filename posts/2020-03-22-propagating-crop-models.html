    <p>I worked with <a href="../cv#croplogic">CropLogic</a> between 2008/11. Their product then was a website for farmers. They’ve since changed the product. I don’t know much about what they’re up to now. The initial work with the crop model I did more than 10 years ago. This was developed by a Crown Research Institute in Lincoln, New Zealand. I worked closely with a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Zyskowski">modeller</a> and an <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hamish_Brown">agronomist</a> from the institute, Rob and Hamish.</p>
<p>Porting the guts of the model from C++ to C# was quick but I needed help from Rob with his domain knowledge to find the bugs I’d introduced. Some of these were to do with differences in programming languages and some were to do with units of measure and the many different ways of quantifying acreage, yields, irrigation flows and fertilizer applications.</p>
<p>The science involves running field experiments, gathering and analysing data, fitting curves and using those equations of fit inside the models. Models have components for soil and components for parts of the plant. Water, insolation and nutrients are input directly or indirectly, like with thermal time.</p>
<p>Equations for evapotranspiration are well known and will be part of every crop model. What about whole models? Zoomed out enough, will they look logically similar? What’s out there and how do they compare?</p>
